Official website for the Santa Clara Laptop Orchestra (SCLOrk)

## Introduction
In my spare time, I am building an official website for SCLOrk! 

Inspired by SCLOrk's dress code for concerts (all black with a color pop), this website will follow a black and white theme with some color pops like the background of the landing page.

I proposed the initial design idea for SCLOrk's website. I'm currently working on the front-end of the website. 

Here's a first look at the landing page:
